Please take a look at the following details about the code in this folder. Its purpose is to upload a file to an S3 bucket using bash. To run the script, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

* Bash must be installed on your system.
* You must have an AWS account and have installed the latest version of the AWS CLI. If you need help with installation, you can find information in this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html "Title").
* You must have configured the AWS CLI to your preference. You can learn how to do that in this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html "Title").
* You must have authenticated the CLI to access your AWS account using your preferred authentication method. Learn how to do that in this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html "Title").

Once you have set up the prerequisites, you can use your terminal of choice to run the code. The code requires two command line arguments to execute successfully:

* The first argument is the path to the file you want to upload, for example, /documents/myfile.txt.
* The second argument is the S3 bucket URI for the file's destination, for example, S3://Bucket_name/folder_name/.

To run the code, use this command as an example:

`uploader.sh /path/to/file S3://Bucket_name/path/to/file/destination`

An error message will be displayed if there are any issues during the upload process.
